Exercise 2: PARENTHESIS - Level Medium

Your goal is to write a function and it's unit test (and docstrings).
This function should do the following task:

Given a String s containing parenthesis, the function should return True if it respects the parenthesis rule
False if it's not.

Examples
    s = '(()'
    parenthesis(s)
    -> False

    s = '()(()())'
    parenthesis(s)
    -> True

    s = '())())(())'
    parenthesis(s)
    -> False

    s = '(((())()))'
    parenthesis(s)
    -> True
Try to find an optimal way of doing it if possible ;)

BONUS: SQUARE BRAQUETS: Change your function so that it handles in an efficient way both square braquets []
and parenthesis rules. (add some cases in unit testing)
